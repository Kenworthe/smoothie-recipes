Things to do: 
-------------------
* Add css: hover on section.recipe should highlight (change color) of the "Favorite" heart.
  * (Either make it fill solid or just highlight it pink)
* change the breakpoint for "small screen width" (currently 468px or something like that.)
* extend the top and bottom of the page to make it look like a banana.
  * change coloring, etc.
